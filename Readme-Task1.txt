Introduction
————————————
This is the app built as part of the assignment for the first week for HPDF program running from Dec 2017 - Feb 2018. 
=======================================================


Task
—————-
The original task was to develop the following two pages using ReactJS and material-UI:
1. Twitter welcome page for a registered user
2. Search results page, on searching for “Aadhaar”

Please see description in the links mentioned for more details of the tasks (refer to the task for the ReactJS group in the link):

=======================================================


Current status
———————————————

As on December 11, 2017 - Only partial implementation of the first page (Twitter welcome page) has been completed. The search page has not been implemented yet

Known issues:
1. The data here is hardcoded and there in no action on clicking on any of these links.
2. The alignment of some of the elements in UI is not correct and is not very appealing. This needs further work.

=======================================================


How to install and run the application:
———————————————————————————————————————
1. Create a new directory in your machine
2. Clone (or download) the project code from the public repository at GitHub - https://github.com/viju99/hpdf-Task1.git
3. Open terminal (or command prompt/shell, whichever is applicable based on the environment) and move to the directory created in step 1 above
4. Run “npm install” from the directory to install and set up all the needed files and dependencies
5. Run “npm start” to launch the app. You may be prompted to change the default port it runs on, in case there is another process already running in that port.In that case, choose “Y” to launch it in another port
6. The app should be launched and loaded in your default browser
